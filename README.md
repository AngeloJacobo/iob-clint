# MyCLINT
RISC-V Core Local Interrupt Controller (CLINT) written in Verilog. The initial focus is for it to work as a IOb-SoC-VexRiscv peripheral.

## Register Map

## Machine-level Timer Device (MTIMER)
(WIP)

## Machine-level Software Interrupt Device (MSWI)
(TO DO)

## Supervisor-level Software Interrupt Device (SSWI)
